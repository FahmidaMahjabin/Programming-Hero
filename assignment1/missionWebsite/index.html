                <p class = "paragraph">The goals of software engineering are straightforward and easy to understand – but they aren’t always easy to meet. This is because there are so many different ways to approach software engineering and so many outcomes that are possible. While we do have best practices and there are standards in place, every software engineer has a different approach and sometimes they don’t always mesh well with other members of an IT team. So our mission is to become a successful software engineer.</p>

                    <p>Software engineering is the discipline of creating high-quality software systems in a systematic, controlled and efficient manner. It involves the application of engineering concepts, techniques, and methods to the design, development, deployment and maintenance of software systems. </p>

                    <p>My desire is to be a world class Software Developer who renders solutions for various problems, with building applications, being a great people manager and a great mentor to upcoming developers in the technology industry.

                    <h1>Goals</h1>
                    <p>There have been a lot of changes in the last months. My work as an employed software developer kind of got to a new level because of the changes in my project. I'm learning a whole lot in this project and am looking forward to learn even more. My employer offers me great opportunities and my spare time projects and my mentoring also extend my horizon. The regular meeting of developers, which I'm organizing, is a fun, informative and empowering event.</p>

                <p>Software developers are the creative, brainstorming masterminds behind computer programs of all sorts. While some software developers may focus on a specific program or app, others create giant networks or underlying systems that help trigger and power other programs. This is why there are two main classifications of developers: applications software developers and systems software developers.</p>

                <p>Job opportunities for software developers are vast and varied. Application software developers held just over 944,200 jobs in 2018, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).3 There were about 421,300 positions for systems software developers in that same year, equating to more than 1.3 million opportunities for software developers</p>
